# bidswf

So what the fuck is bidswf? It's not the source code I wrote. It's the compiled and obfuscated version of the swf file alltobid.com used to do online car bidding. I know there are plenty of programmers out there who are trying to do reengineering work with the god-damn swf file. That is sort of what hackers do.

To do that, you need to
  - Get the swf file (this is what I provided here)
  - Decompile it
  - Read the fucking source code
  - Write your own code

> Seek, and you shall find

Happy hacking!

P.S.: I'm gonna remove this repository permanently in 24 hours.
